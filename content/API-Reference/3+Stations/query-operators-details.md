# Query station operator details
After you [queried a `station`](/API-Reference/Stations/query-station-details) you will be able to fetch the operator details through this `operator` query. It will provide you with a wide range of information such as the `name`, `website` and `logo` of the operator.

## Query
To query the operator details you do need an operator `id`. You can get this `id` from the [`station`](/API-Reference/Stations/query-station-details) query that you just executed.
