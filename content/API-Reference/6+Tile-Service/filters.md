# Filters

To render stations on a map, you need to add a set of filters to the tile request. These filters are sent as query parameters and must be appended after `?`.

<note display="block">
The tile service will only return results once a combination of powers and connectors are applied.
</note>

## Filters
Below you can find an overview of possible filters you can apply.

<!-- Static schema generated by hand. Edits can be done in static/schema/TileFilters.json and any of it's children -->
<schema name="tileFilter"></schema>

## Count
You can request the number of displayed stations on the map by using the following API endpoint. If you applied any filters you will need to apply them to the count endpoint as well to make sure you receive the correct count.

<code-block lang="html" prefix="Tile Service" title="Count Endpoint">
https://api.chargetrip.io/station/count.json
https://api.chargetrip.io/station/count.json?powers[]=22&powers[]=43&connectors[]=CHADEMO&connectors[]=IEC_62196_T2_COMBO&amenities[]=restaurant&availableOnly=true
</code-block>

It will return a response that looks like this:

<code-block lang="json" prefix="Tile Service" title="Count Endpoint">
{
    "count": 158
}
</code-block>
