# Authorization

Before you can start with our API you need to be able to authorize yourself. You can do this by [signing up](http://dashboard.chargetrip.com/) and [configuring](/Getting-Started/API-Basics/getting-started#configuring-your-project) your own free key. After youâ€™ve done that we will guide you through the process of configuring your key and authorizing yourself.

## The API
Now that you have all necessary credentials you can start using our API. The first thing you need is the following base url:

<code-block lang="bash" prefix="Authorization" title="Base Url">					
https://api.chargetrip.io/graphql
</code-block>

## Authorization process
To communicate with the chargetrip API, we require authorization on our endpoints as well as our websocket. Authentication can be done on one or two levels. If you provide us only with your `x-client-id` we will use this project configuration and the default `x-app-id` associated with it.

If you would like to split up your analytics per platform you can provide an additional `x-app-id`. This way your requests will be categorised on this level. 

Apart from the `x-app-id` and `x-client-id` there are two other headers: `x-app-identifier` and `x-app-fingerprint`. Both of these are used to implement security restrictions. The `x-app-identifier` is used to set the iOS or Android bundle identifier. The `x-app-fingerprint` is only used for Android and requires the SHA fingerprint of the Android application. Learn more about security over [here](/Getting-Started/API-Basics/security).

If we want to reflect this as a curl it would look like this;

<code-block lang="bash" prefix="Authorization" title="Curl">
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "x-client-id: 5e8c22366f9c5f23ab0eff39" \
-H "x-app-id: 5e8c22366f9c5f23ab0eff39" \
-d 'query { }' \
https://api.chargetrip.io/graphql
</code-block>
