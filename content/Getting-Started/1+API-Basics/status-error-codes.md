# Status & Error Codes

To ensure you can respond appropriately when our API gives unexpected output, we maintain a consistent set of API response and error codes. The general design of these will be discussed inside this chapter.

## API Response Codes

Our API uses the following response status codes, as defined in the [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) and [RFC 6568](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6585.txt);

<status-table :statuses="statuses" :descriptions="statusDescriptions"></status-table>

## API Error Objects

Apart from the response codes, unsuccessful responses return their generic GraphQL error described here alongside some additional fields. The additional fields can be found inside the extensions object. The most important one here is the exception object. This contains all the information about the error and looks as follows;

<property-table :keys="keys" :types="types" :descriptions="descriptions"></property-table>

If we want to reflect this as a curl it would look like this;

<code-block lang="json" prefix="Error" title="Error objects">
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "The car was not found in the database",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "addReview"
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "exception": {
          "response": "CAR_NOT_FOUND",
          "status": 500,
          "message": "No car was found with the provided ID",
          "code": "CAR_NOT_FOUND"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
</code-block>
